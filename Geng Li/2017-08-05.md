“Sample sizes are never large. If N is too small to get a
sufficiently-precise estimate, you need to get more data (or make more
assumptions). But once N is “large enough,” you can start subdividing the
data to learn more (for example, in a public opinion poll, once you have a
good estimate for the entire country, you can estimate among men and women,
northerners and southerners, different age groups, etc). N is never enough
because if it were “enough” you’d already be on to the next problem for
which you need more data.”
