### Disrupt software
@ 8/6/17 8:41:26 PM

If there is a tool, e.g. apo dynamics, it means people are not building it
monitoring in the first place.

If 89% of code is error handing and edge cases then that is where the
opportunity is

If  software is not 50% app code and 50% test code there is an opportunity
in test code too
